        Procedure:<br>
        Dijkstra(G: weighted connected simple graph, with all weights
        positive)<br>
        G has vertices a = v0, v1, ..., an = z and length is w(vi, vj) where w(vi, vj)

        and S is the empty set while z is a vertex not in S with L(u) minimal S = SSu
        for all vertices v not in S if <br>L(u) + w(u, v) < L(v)thenL(v) = L(u) + w(u, v)<br>

      <h1>How does Dijkstra’s Algorithm work?</h1><br>
      <p class="content">
        Dijkstra’s algorithm begins by labeling a with 0 and the other vertices
        with . We use the notation L0(a) = 0 and L0(v) = for these labels before
        any iterations have taken place (the subscript 0 stands for the “0th”
        iteration). These labels are the lengths of shortest paths from a to the
        vertices, where the paths contain only the vertex a. (Because no path
        from a to a vertex different from a exists, is the length of the
        shortest path between a and this vertex.) Dijkstra’s algorithm proceeds
        by forming a distinguished set of vertices. Let Sk denote this set after
        k iterations of the labeling procedure. We begin with S0 = . The set Sk
        is formed from S(k 1) by adding a vertex u not in S(k 1) with the
        smallest label. Once u is added to Sk, we update the labels of all
        vertices not in Sk, so that Lk(v), the label of the vertex v at the kth
        stage, is the length of the shortest path from a to v that contains
        vertices only in Sk (that is, vertices that were already in the
        distinguished set together with u). Note that the way we choose the
        vertex u to add to Sk at each step is an optimal choice at each step,
        making this a greedy algorithm. (We will prove shortly that this greedy
        algorithm always produces an optimal solution.) Let v be a vertex not in
        Sk. To update the label of v, note that Lk(v) is the length of the
        shortest path from a to v containing only vertices in Sk. The updating
        can be carried out efficiently when this observation is used: The
        shortest path from a to v containing only elements of Sk is either the
        shortest path from a to v that contains only elements of S(k 1) (that
        is, the distinguished vertices not including u), or it is the shortest
        path from a to u at the (k 1)st stage with the edge (u,v) added. In
        other words, Lk(a,v) = min[Lk1(a,v),Lk1(a,u) + w(u,v)] where w(u,v) is
        the length of the edge with u and v as endpoints. This procedure is
        iterated by successively adding vertices to the distinguished set until
        z is added. When z is added to the distinguished set, its label is the
        length of the shortest path from a to z.

        <b>EXAMPLE:</b> Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the length of the shortest path
        between the vertices a and z in the weighted graph displayed in Figure a.

      <p class="content">
        <b>Solution:</b> In figure (a) according to the algorithm first, we set a with 0 and all
        other vertices with .L0(a) = 0 and L0(v) = . and first we set Sk = 0 Sk shows
        the path after kth iteration. In the above example, we find the shortest path for
        all vertices. And finally, we reach z. we do all this procedure by calculating the
        distance.

      <p class="content">
        In figure (b) first we calculate the path for b and c from a.so we write (a) at
        the b and c. this shows us from which path we reach those vertices. We also
        store its distance there.

      <p class="content">
        In figure (c) we can see that for vertices b the other way is (a,c,b) and its
        total distance is (2+1=3) is less than previous(4) so we replace its shortest path
        by (a,c).and another way for c is (a,b,c) its total distance is (4+1=5) is greater
        than 2 so we do not replace it by (a,b,c). hear we also store the path for d and e
        from (a,c). hear we set the path for d and e from c because its distance is lesser
        than b (2,3).

      <p class="content">
        In figure (d) then we consider another way for d from previous vertices b
        (because we already calculated its distance from c)and if its distance is lesser
        than c then we replace the path and distance for d.the shortest path and distance
        for d is (a,c,b) and 8.

        In figure (e) the same things will be done with e. hear we also store the
        shortest way for e.and then we calculate the way for z from d because its distance
        is lesser than e (8¡10) and store it. the shortest path and distance for e are
        (a,c,b,d) and 10.
