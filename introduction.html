            Mathematics is used everywhere And especially discrete. in this article, I am
            going to talk about shortest path finding problems. In graph theory, the shortest
            path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in
            a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.
            The problem of finding the shortest path between two intersections on a road
            map may be modeled as a special case of the shortest path problem in graphs,
            where the vertices correspond to intersections and the edges correspond to
            road segments, each weighted by the length of the segment. Several different
            algorithms find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. We
            will present a greedy algorithm discovered by the Dutch mathematician Edsger
            Dijkstra in 1959. The version we will describe solves this problem in undirected
            weighted graphs where all the weights are positive. It is easy to adapt it to solve
            shortest-path problems in directed graphs. Before giving a formal presentation
            of the algorithm, we will give an illustrative example. Application Description
            and Motivation The motive of this article is how we apply discrete mathematics
            in real life. we are people of the 21st century so we should be the fastest. and
            we make things easy and we also found many ways to make our work easier and
            easier. hear such a one of the type of problem is...... suppose a and b are two
            places. I want to go from a to b, then there are many ways for that. So find what is
            the SHORTEST PATH between them. There are lots of ways for going from a
            to b. Some are large and some are short. So to save our time and make our way
            easy we choose the shortest path between both places. Such a type of problem
            and its solution will be discussed Here the letter.
