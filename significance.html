            In our project first, we found one real-life problem. The problem is how we find
            the shortest way from one place to another place. 
            The shortest way is for roads and airlines and it also helps in computer networking
            and many fields.<br>
            Then we gave its solution by an algorithm and showed how it works.<br>
            Significance of the solution is it makes our way shortest and saves our time.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> Suppose we want to go from one city to another city. So we can
            apply this algorithm for finding the shortest way. We indicate cities to the
            vertices and way to the edges. In lots of ways, we find the shortest form of this
            algorithm.

            So through Dijkstra’s algorithm, we can find the shortest path between two
            places. It will help us a lot in our regular life, and save our most valuable time
            and make our life easier.
