            Here, I give one example on such type of problems.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b>
            What is the length of the shortest path between a and z in the weighted graph shown in Figure?

            Solution :<br>Although the shortest path is easily found by inspection, we will
            develop some ideas useful in understanding Dijkstra’s algorithm. We will solve
            this problem by finding the length of the shortest path from a to successive
            vertices until z is reached. A path that starts at a that has no interior vertices
            other than a must consist of one edge that has an as one of its endpoints. These
            are the one-edged paths a, b of length 4 and a, d of length 2. It follows that d
            is the closest vertex to a, and the shortest path from a to d has length 2. We
            can find the second closest vertex by examining all paths that begin with the
            shortest path from a to a vertex in the set a, d, followed by an edge that has
            one endpoint in a, d and its other endpoint not in this set. There are two such
            paths to consider, a, d, e of length 7 and a, b of length 4. Hence, the second
            closest vertex to a is b, and the shortest path from a to b has a length of 4. To
            find the third closest vertex to a, we need to examine only the paths that begin
            with the shortest path from a to a vertex in the set a, d, and b, followed by an
            edge that has one endpoint in the set a, d, b and its other endpoint not in this
            set. There are three such paths, a, b, c of length 7, a, b, e of length 7, and a,
            d, e of length 5. Because the shortest of these paths is a, d, e, the third closest
            vertex to a is e, and the length of the shortest path from a to e is 5. To find the
            fourth closest vertex to a, we need to examine only the paths that begin with
            the shortest path from a to a vertex in the set a, d, b, e, followed by an edge
            that has one endpoint in the set a, d, b, e and its other endpoint not in this set.
            There are two such paths, a, b, c of length 7 and a, d, e, z of length 6. Because
            the shorter of these paths is a, d, e, z, the fourth closest vertex to a is z, and
            the length of the shortest path from a to z is 6. we will see its solution using
            Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
